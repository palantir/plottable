     * Returns the sortedIndex for inserting a value into an array.
     * Takes a number and an array of numbers OR an array of objects and an accessor that returns a number.
     * @param {number} value: The numerical value to insert
     * @param {any[]} arr: Array to find insertion index, can be number[] or any[] (if accessor provided)
     * @param {_IAccessor} accessor: If provided, this function is called on members of arr to determine insertion index
     * @returns {number} The insertion index.
     * The behavior is undefined for arrays that are unsorted
     * If there are multiple valid insertion indices that maintain sorted order (e.g. addign 1 to [1,1,1,1,1]) then
     * the behavior must satisfy that the array is sorted post-insertion, but is otherwise unspecified.
     * This is a modified version of Underscore.js's implementation of sortedIndex.
