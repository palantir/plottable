  "readme": "phantomjs\n=========\n\nAn NPM wrapper for [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), headless webkit with JS API.\n\nBuilding and Installing\n-----------------------\n\n```shell\nnpm install phantomjs\n```\n\nOr grab the source and\n\n```shell\nnode ./install.js\n```\n\nTo use a mirror of the phantomjs binaries, set `$PHANTOMJS_CDNURL`,\ndefault is `https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads`\n\n```shell\nPHANTOMJS_CDNURL=http://cnpmjs.org/downloads npm install phantomjs\n```\n\nWhat this installer is really doing is just grabbing a particular \"blessed\" (by\nthis module) version of Phantom. As new versions of Phantom are released\nand vetted, this module will be updated accordingly.\n\nThe package has been set up to fetch and run Phantom for MacOS (darwin),\nLinux based platforms (as identified by nodejs), and -- as of version 0.2.0 --\nWindows (thanks to [Domenic Denicola](https://github.com/domenic)).  If you\nspot any platform weirdnesses, let us know or send a patch.\n\nRunning\n-------\n\n```shell\nbin/phantomjs [phantom arguments]\n```\n\nAnd npm will install a link to the binary in `node_modules/.bin` as\nit is wont to do.\n\nRunning via node\n----------------\n\nThe package exports a `path` string that contains the path to the\nphantomjs binary/executable.\n\nBelow is an example of using this package via node.\n\n```javascript\nvar path = require('path')\nvar childProcess = require('child_process')\nvar phantomjs = require('phantomjs')\nvar binPath = phantomjs.path\n\nvar childArgs = [\n  path.join(__dirname, 'phantomjs-script.js'),\n  'some other argument (passed to phantomjs script)'\n]\n\nchildProcess.execFile(binPath, childArgs, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  // handle results\n})\n\n```\n\nVersioning\n----------\n\nThe major and minor number tracks the version of PhantomJS that will be\ninstalled. The patch number is incremented when there is either an installer\nupdate or a patch build of the phantom binary.\n\nA Note on PhantomJS\n-------------------\n\nPhantomJS is not a library for NodeJS.  It's a separate environment and code\nwritten for node is unlikely to be compatible.  In particular PhantomJS does\nnot expose a Common JS package loader.\n\nThis is an _NPM wrapper_ and can be used to conveniently make Phantom available\nIt is not a Node JS wrapper.\n\nI have had reasonable experiences writing standalone Phantom scripts which I\nthen drive from within a node program by spawning phantom in a child process.\n\nRead the PhantomJS FAQ for more details: http://phantomjs.org/faq.html\n\n### Linux Note\n\nAn extra note on Linux usage, from the PhantomJS download page:\n\n > This package is built on CentOS 5.8. It should run successfully on Lucid or\n > more modern systems (including other distributions). There is no requirement\n > to install Qt, WebKit, or any other libraries. It is however expected that\n > some base libraries necessary for rendering (FreeType, Fontconfig) and the\n > basic font files are available in the system.\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\n##### Installation fails with `Error: read ECONNRESET` or `Error: connect ETIMEDOUT`\n\nThis error means that something went wront with your internet connection, and the installer\nwas not able to download the PhantomJS binary for your platform. Please try again.\n\n##### I tried again, but I get `ECONNRESET` or `ETIMEDOUT` consistently.\n\nDo you live in China, or a country with an authoritarian government? We've seen problems where\nthe GFW or local ISP blocks bitbucket, preventing the installer from downloading the binary.\n\nTry visiting the [the download page](http://cdn.bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads) manually.\nIf that page is blocked, you can try using a different CDN with the `PHANTOMJS_CDNURL`\nenv variable described above.\n\n##### I am behind a corporate proxy that uses self-signed SSL certificates to intercept encrypted traffic.\n\nYou can tell NPM and the PhantomJS installer to skip validation of ssl keys with NPM's \n[strict-ssl](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-config.html#strict-ssl) setting:\n\n```\nnpm set strict-ssl false\n```\n\nWARNING: Turning off `strict-ssl` leaves you vulnerable to attackers reading\nyour encrypted traffic, so run this at your own risk!\n\n##### I tried everything, but my network is b0rked. What do I do?\n\nIf you install PhantomJS manually, and put it on PATH, the installer will try to\nuse the manually-installed binaries.\n\n##### I'm on Debian or Ubuntu, and the installer failed because it couldn't find `node`\n\nSome Linux distros tried to rename `node` to `nodejs` due to a package\nconflict. This is a non-portable change, and we do not try to support this. The\n[official documentation](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#ubuntu-mint-elementary-os)\nrecommends that you symlink `node` to `nodejs` on those platforms, or many\nNodeJS programs won't work properly.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nQuestions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.  Submit them at\n[the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Obvious/phantomjs/).  If you haven't contributed to an\n[Obvious](http://github.com/Obvious/) project before please head over to the\n[Open Source Project](https://github.com/Obvious/open-source#note-to-external-contributors) and fill\nout an OCLA (it should be pretty painless).\n\nBug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are the\nbest. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests.\n\nAuthor\n------\n\n[Dan Pupius](https://github.com/dpup)\n([personal website](http://pupius.co.uk)), supported by\n[The Obvious Corporation](http://obvious.com/).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2012 [The Obvious Corporation](http://obvious.com/).\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\nSee the top-level file `LICENSE.txt` and\n(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n",
