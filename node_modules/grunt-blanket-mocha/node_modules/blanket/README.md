**NOTE:** Blanket.js will throw XHR cross domain errors if run with the file:// protocol.  See [Special Features Guide](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/special_features.md) for more details and workarounds.


## Getting Started

Please see the following guides for using Blanket.js:

**Browser**
* [Getting Started](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_browser.md) (Basic QUnit usage)
* [Intermediate](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/intermediate_browser.md) (Other test runners, global options)
* [Advanced](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/advanced_browser.md) (writing your own reporters/adapters)
* [Special Features Guide](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/special_features.md)

**Node**
* [Getting Started](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_node.md) (basic mocha setup)
* [Intermediate](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/intermediate_node.md) (mocha testrunner, travis-ci reporter)


## Philosophy

Blanket.js is a code coverage tool for javascript that aims to be:

1. Easy to install
2. Easy to use
3. Easy to understand

Blanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.


## Mechanism

JavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).

Blanket works in a 3 step process:

1. Loading your source files
2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.
3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.

## Grunt Integration

You've got a few options for using Grunt with Blanket:

**grunt-blanket**

A Grunt plugin has been created to allow you to use Blanket like a "traditional" code coverage tool (creating instrumented copies of physical files, as opposed to live-instrumenting).
The plugin runs as a standlone project and can be found [here](https://github.com/alex-seville/grunt-blanket).

**grunt-blanket-qunit**

Runs the QUnit-based Blanket report headlessly using PhantomJS.  Results are displayed on the console, and the task will cause Grunt to fail if any of your configured coverage thresholds are not met. Minimum code coverage thresholds can be configured per-file, per-module, and globally.

See:

* [Plugin Repo](https://github.com/ModelN/grunt-blanket-qunit)
* [Blog Walkthrough](http://www.geekdave.com/2013/07/20/code-coverage-enforcement-for-qunit-using-grunt-and-blanket/)

## Compatibility and Features List

See the [Compatiblity and Feature List](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/compatibility_and_features.md) including links to working examples.


## Roll your own

1. `git clone git@github.com:alex-seville/blanket.git`  
2. `npm install`  
3. Add your custom build details to the grunt.js file under `concat`
3. `grunt buildit` 

A minified and unminfied copy of the source can be created (see the `min` task).  


## Development

**All development takes place on the `development` branch**  
**Your pull request must pass all tests (run `npm test` to be sure) and respect all existing coverage thresholds**

## Revision History

May 1-13 - 1.1.4  
Loaded reverting for grunt-blanket, branch tracking reporter fixed, coverage on-the-go (displaying coverage results while a single page is being used).  
  
Apr 28-13 - 1.1.3
YUI support added with custom adapter (and some wrapping code).  CompoundJS support appears to be outside the scope of project.
