  "readme": "# grunt-blanket-mocha\n\n> Headless Blanket.js code coverage and Mocha testing via PhantomJS\n\n## Wat?\n\nOther plugins look similar, but are different in that they:\n\n* Only test *server-side* code\n* Create *new instrumented copies* of your source code for coverage detection\n* Generate coverage reports in HTML or JSON formats requiring a separate step to parse and evaluate coverage\n* Do not *enforce* coverage thresholds, but just report on it\n\nThis plugin, however:\n\n* Runs *client-side* mocha specs\n* Performs code coverage \"live\" using BlanketJS, without creating separate instrumented copies\n* Reports coverage info directly to the Grunt task\n* Will fail the build if minimum coverage thresholds are not defined\n\n## Parent Plugin\n\nThis plugin is based on [kmiyashiro/grunt-mocha](https://github.com/kmiyashiro/grunt-mocha/tree/8e72249b1042a270641633a69725ccf63fa10259) v0.4.10 and supports all the\nconfigurations of that plugin as of that version.  Please see that repo for more options on configuration.\n\nChanges from the upstream plugin will be merged periodically.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-blanket-mocha --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-blanket-mocha');\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* Blanket.js (tested with v1.1.5)\n* Mocha (tested with v1.14.0)\n\n## The \"blanket_mocha\" task\n\n### See Also\n\nThis plugin is based off of grunt-contrib-mocha.  For general config options and examples, please see that repo.\n\n## Setup\n\n### Demo\n\nSee the `example` and `example-requires` directories for a fully-working examples of the setup, including some of the scaffolding required to get all the pieces to fit together.  The `README` in that directory will walk you through it.\n\n### Gruntfile\n\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `blanket_mocha` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  blanket_mocha: {\n    test: {\n      src: ['specs/test.html'],\n      options : {\n          threshold : 70\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUse the `all` param to specify where your mocha browser spec HTML file lives.\nThis works the same way as it does in the base `grunt-mocha` plugin.\n\nNOTE: Be sure to include the blanketJS script tag in your test html file\n\n### Blanket Adapter\n\nTo allow Blanket to communicate with the parent Grunt process, add this snippet in your test HTML, after all the\nother scripts:\n\n```html\n<script>\n    if (window.PHANTOMJS) {\n        blanket.options(\"reporter\", \"../node_modules/grunt-blanket-mocha/support/grunt-reporter.js\");\n    }\n</script>\n```\n\nNOTE: The above path is assuming that the specs are being run from a directory one deeper than the root directory.\nAdjust the path accordingly.\n\nNOTE 2: The conditional `if (window.PHANTOMJS)` statement is there because of the hacky way that messages are passed\nbetween an HTML page and the PhantomJS process (using alerts).  Without this condition, you would get bombarded\nwith alert messages in your in-browser mocha report.\n\n### BlanketJS HTML Report\n\nIf you want to see blanketJS coverage reports in the browser as well (useful for visually scanning which lines have\ncoverage and which do not) include this snippet it in your test html blanket and mocha.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../node_modules/grunt-blanket-mocha/support/mocha-blanket.js\"></script>\n```\n\nNOTE: The above path is assuming that the specs are being run from a directory one deeper than the root directory.\nAdjust the path accordingly.\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.threshold\nType: `Number`\nDefault value: `60`\n\nThe minimum percent coverage per-file.  Any files that have coverage below this threshold will fail the build.  By default, only the failing files will be output in the console.  To show passing files as well, use the grunt `--verbose` option.\n\n#### options.moduleThreshold\nType: `Number`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nThe minimum percent coverage per-module.  Any modules that have coverage below this threshold will fail the build.  Both passing and failing module statistics will be shown in the output.\n\nThis option requires that the `modulePattern` property is also set (see below).\n\n#### options.modulePattern\nType: `RegEx`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nA regular expression defining how to extract a module name from the path of a covered file.  The regular expression should include\na single parenthetical expression which will be matched as the module name.  For example, to define the module name as the text\nin between the first two slashes, you could use:\n\n```\nmodulePattern: \"./(.*?)/\"\n```\n\n#### options.globalThreshold\nType: `Number`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nThe minimum percent coverage overall, averaged for all files.  An average coverage percentage below this\nvalue will fail the build.Both passing and failing module statistics will be shown in the output.\n\n#### options.excludedFiles\nType: `Array`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nList filenames that need to be excluded. This will inform the Grunt Task to not mark these files as failed. The result will be printed as,\nSKIP: [..%] filename\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nexcludedFiles: [\n  \"./src/my/file1.js\",\n  \"./src/my/project/file2.js\"\n]\n```\n\n#### options.customThreshold\nType: `Object`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nList filenames that should have their own special threshold.  This is useful for the case when there are a few files with poor\ncoverage in your project, and you don't want them to hold you back from enforcing an overall high threshold.  Or you may have\ncertain files that you want to hold to a higher standard than others, using a higher threshold.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\ncustomThreshold: {\n  \"./src/my/file1.js\" : 33,\n  \"./src/my/project/file2.js\" : 45\n}\n```\n\n#### options.customModuleThreshold\nType: `Object`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nList module names that should have their own special threshold.  This is useful for the case when there are a few modules with poor\ncoverage in your project, and you don't want them to hold you back from enforcing an overall high threshold. Or you may have\ncertain modules that you want to hold to a higher standard than others, using a higher threshold.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\ncustomModuleThreshold: {\n  \"users\" : 60,\n  \"security\" : 90\n}\n```\n\n\n### Command Line Options\n\n#### threshold\n\nOverride the threshold specified in the Gruntfile.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to test your files using a 90% threshold, and the Gruntfile had a different threshold specified, you could override it like so:\n\n`grunt --threshold=90`\n\n#### moduleThreshold\n\nOverride the moduleThreshold specified in the Gruntfile.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to test your files using a 90% module threshold, and the Gruntfile had a different module threshold specified, you could override it like so:\n\n`grunt --moduleThreshold=90`\n\n#### globalThreshold\n\nOverride the globalThreshold specified in the Gruntfile.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to test your files using a 90% global threshold, and the Gruntfile had a different global threshold specified, you could override it like so:\n\n`grunt --globalThreshold=90`\n\n#### excludedFiles\n\nList the files to be excluded as an array.\nExample,\n`grunt --excludedFiles=[\"./src/my/file1.js\", \"./src/my/project/file2.js\"]`\n\n#### grep\n\nOnly run test specs that match a certain pattern.\n\nFor example, if you only wanted to run specs that match the word \"login\" you could run:\n\n`grunt --grep=\"login\"`\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
